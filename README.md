# ELK Stack Configuration and Setup

This repository provides the setup files and configuration required to deploy an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack using Docker. This setup is designed to efficiently aggregate, search, and visualize logs from different sources, helping monitor and troubleshoot application and server performance.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `.env.example`: Environment variable template for your project. Copy this to `.env` and set values as needed.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by version control.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and orchestrates the ELK stack services.
- `filebeat.yml`: Configuration for Filebeat to ship log data to Logstash.
- `logstash.conf`: Logstash configuration file for parsing and filtering logs.
- `metricbeat.yml`: Configuration for Metricbeat to collect system and service metrics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- Basic knowledge of ELK stack and Docker.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the required values.
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start ELK Stack**:
   Use Docker Compose to bring up the stack.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will launch the ELK stack services in detached mode.

4. **Access Services**:
   - **Kibana**: Visit [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)
   - **Elasticsearch**: Available at [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)

5. **Verify Setup**:
   To ensure the services are running, use the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

6. **Test and Send Logs**:
   To send logs to Logstash, use this curl command:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:${LOGSTASH_PORT}" \
-u "${LOGSTASH_USER}:${LOGSTASH_PASSWORD}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
      "timestamp": "2023-08-17T12:34:56Z",
      "message": "hello world",
      "level": "INFO",
      "Service": "Service1",
      "environment": "dev"
    }'
   ```

## 📘 Configuration Files Explained

### docker-compose.yml

Orchestrates the ELK stack. Configures each service (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat, and Metricbeat) and defines volumes and ports.

### filebeat.yml

Filebeat configuration for collecting and forwarding log data to Logstash. Customize paths to log files or add modules for specific applications.

### logstash.conf

Logstash configuration to filter, parse, and forward logs to Elasticsearch. Update this file to specify log parsing and transformation rules based on your needs.

### metricbeat.yml

Metricbeat configuration to collect and visualize server and application metrics. This can be customized to collect metrics for different services and processes.

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- **Adjust Index Names**: Modify index patterns in `logstash.conf` and `filebeat.yml` to match your project's requirements.
- **Add Modules**: Enable additional Filebeat and Metricbeat modules to capture data from specific services.
- **Volume Mapping**: Adjust volume mappings in `docker-compose.yml` to include additional log file locations.

## 📊 Visualizing Data

1. **Set up Index Patterns** in Kibana:
   - Navigate to **Kibana > Discover**.
   - Create index patterns for Elasticsearch indices to start exploring logs and metrics.

2. **Dashboards**:
   - Use built-in dashboards or create custom visualizations to gain insights into your data.

## 🧹 Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop the services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove containers, networks, and volumes:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
